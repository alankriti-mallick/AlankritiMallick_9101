Question : Write the code for finding all common substrings between two strings of size m and n in O(mn) preferably in one pass
The function should also return an array for matched indexes as: The array contains 4 elements as i*4 = start idx from X i*4+1 = end idx from X + 1 i*4+2 = start idx from Y i*4+3= end idx from Y + 1 for ith substring, and also the number of matched substrings
This should in turn be used to print all substrings that is greater than or equal to filterSize.
